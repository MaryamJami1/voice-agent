## Prompt

now commit all changes and push to github

## Response snapshot

I'll help you commit your changes and push them to GitHub. I'll follow the SDD workflow by creating a Prompt History Record (PHR) first, as required by your project instructions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Styling polish phase completed with refined UI components and global styles.
- 🧪 Tests: No new tests added; existing tests should be verified before push.
- 📁 Files: Updated multiple UI components and global CSS for better visual aesthetics.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with further feature development or bug fixes.
- 🧠 Reflection: The styling polish improved the consistency of the UI across the dashboard and audio visualizer.
